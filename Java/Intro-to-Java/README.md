# Intro to Java 🚀

Welcome to the world of Java programming!  

Programming languages let us **tell computers what to do**. With the right instructions, computers can run apps, systems, and basically everything we use every day.  

Java was released by **Sun Microsystems** in **1995**. People like it because it’s **simple, portable, secure, and robust**. Even after 20+ years, it’s still super popular.  

One cool thing about Java is the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. It makes sure your **Java code can run on any platform or OS**. That’s why Sun’s slogan was **“write once, run everywhere”**.
